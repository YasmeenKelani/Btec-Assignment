# Stage 1 Project Design 
### Task 2 -1
**Compare Between tools**

|Category  |     Tool1     |  tool2 |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| IDE	   |  VS code  | PyCharm|
|Operating System | Linux   |  Windows |
|Version-control |GitHub    | GitLab  |

**Visual studio code and Pycharm**

* Visual studio code: is the best text editor from Microsoft. The editor is free and open-source also works on many operating system like windows, Mac OS  X, and Linux. The editor is based on the Electron environment and was launched by Microsoft in April 2015.
Code completion is supported by VSCode, and it is quite capable. Although VSCode did not automatically add the import statement for my new module, once it was done, VSCode was able to provide autocomplete for this method. You can run your code in debug mode and step through it with VSCode. The left pane displays local and global variables, watched values, the call stack and a list of all breakpoints. To see the current value of a variable, move your mouse over it. All of the typical execution controls, such as step over, step into, and step out, are also available. You can also construct conditional breakpoints with VSCode, which is useful if you're looking for a certain data condition that's causing issues. For Python, VSCode has a good debugger. It receives a 4/5. 

- supported programming languages: Because it is not limited to a single field, Visual Studio Code primarily supports a wide range of programming languages. C and C++, as well as Microsoft C#, are among the languages supported by this editor. It also supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are all widely used web languages. It also supports a variety of backend languages, as well as a variety of others, If a language isn't already supported, the editor provides plugins to add support for it.

* Pycharm: is a programming environment for computers, specifically python programming. JetBrains' product includes code analysis, graphical error detection, built-in unit testing tools, integration with audit control systems, support for Django web development, and workflow. Anaconda data science applications are based on the Anaconda programming language.

- Supported programming languages: Paycharm is a multi-platform application that runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The Apache license applies to the community edition, and there is also a professional edition with additional licensed features. 

**Linux and Windows**

* Linux could be a free and open-source operating system that adheres to industry standards. It provides a programming interface that is still program compatible with operating system-based platforms, as well as a large number of applications. A UNIX operating system system also includes a number of independently built components. leading to a completely compatible and free-of-proprietary-code UNIX operating system. 

* Windows: It's possible that Windows is a commissioned operating system that makes ASCII text files unavailable. It's intended for persons who have no prior programming experience, as well as business and alternative industrial users. It's quite simple to use and understand. 

|Linux  |  Windows    | 
|----------|:-------------:|
|Linux is a open source operating system. | Windows are the not the open source operating system. | 
|Linux is free of cost.      |    Windows is costly.           |   
|It’s file name case-sensitive.|    It’s file name is case-insensitive. | 
|Linux is widely used in hacking purpose based systems.|  Windows does not provide much efficiency in hacking.|


```
- Privacy: 
If you use Linux, you have an operating system that does not track your activities. When you use Linux, the system is yours and yours alone. You can also add the fact that most Linux computers have built-in military-grade encryption as an option. As a user, you may rest assured that data theft is not a serious concern.

In fact, over the last few years, Windows has become more ad-driven. Users will undoubtedly be given the option to opt out, but who can help the ingenious registry hacks that are plainly part of Redmond's plan? Windows can monitor users' activities and offer to sync them to the Microsoft One-Drive service or study their habits in order to improve Cortana (Microsoft's personal assistant). To be honest, I dislike these gadgets because they are quite obtrusive. Some users, however, enjoy these characteristics. Opinions are subjective.

**GitLab and GitHub**

* GitLab: is a repository hosting manager solution created by GitLab Inc that is used in the software development process. 
* GitHub: is a repository hosting service with collaboration and access control capabilities. It's a place where programmers may collaborate to solve problems and host open-source projects.

|Parameters |   GitLab   |GitHub |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
|Advantages	|GitLab is community edition is open source and free to use. and It is a very secure cloud-native application.  |It aids in the creation of a well-organized project document. It's utilized to show off your work in front of an audience.|
|Disadvantages |GitLab has a lot of issues, which makes the user experience sloppy.For first-timers, managing code reviews is tricky.|There is a small private repository available. Only Git version control is supported. |
|Open source |GitLab's community edition is open-source.|GitHub is not open source.|

## Task 2 -2 
**Choosen Tools**
* I chose vs-code because it offers a lightning-fast source code editor that is perfect for everyday use. It Code, which supports hundreds of languages, highlights syntax so that we may get started right away. VS Code also works with build and scripting tools to perform common tasks, which speeds up day-to-day tasks. 
- Git support is available in VS Code, allowing us to interact with source control without having to leave the editor, including view.

* I choose Linux over Windows because it is more dependable. It's safer for a group of people to see what's going on in the code and collaborate to find the best solution. It has a great security system as well. It provides us with the Customization function, which gives it a distinct advantage over other operating systems. It's an open source operating system, thus it's free to use. Depending on your demands, you can edit, add, or delete any feature. 

* I choose GitHub because it is becoming known as an open-source world, which means that if you want to run an open core or open-source project, users will understand how it works, and it allows for easy sharing and control.
